Prince Quisborne is a large, descriptive, puzzly text adventure game with some old-school flavor but new-school convenience and depth. Additional description of the game, public ratings, and public reviews can be found on [IFDB](https://ifdb.org/viewgame?id=wfms4lves15ao642).

Currently I'm only using this repository to keep updated versions of Prince Quisborne immediately available without having to wait for IF-Archive uploads. 

(The "source" files in the releases section do not contain source code, they're actually an outdated version of the game file that I can't get rid of because GitHub automatically generates them.)
